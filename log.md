**## Notes **

-currently trying out c++ and SDL2 to see if i can create my own rhythm game... also, creating game art is so hard XD. to all the game art designers out there, thank you for all your hard work. I will try my best to create my own assets and game sprites, but in the rare chance i borrow art from other designers, I will make sure to credit them here and on itch.io
