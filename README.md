***9/19/23**
currently trying out c++ and SDL2 to see if i can create my own rhythm game...

also, creating game art is so hard XD.
to all the game art designers out there, thank you for all your hard work.
I will try my best to create my own assets and game sprites, but in the rare chance i borrow art from other designers,
I will make sure to credit them here and on itch.io

Thanks, and have a good day.
